non-terminatig substitution
	- a guarded substitution for which the guard does not hold
	- model of a program "crash"
	
Parametrization - leave open a number of *finite* dimensions

* to be defined later (refinement/instantiation)
* scalars or finite, non-empty sets
* formal set parameters are **independent** sets

Implicit constants: ```maxint, minint, INT, NAT, NAT1```

Operation - output parameters
