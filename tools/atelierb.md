
Usage notes Atelier-B
=====================


Setup for projects shared with git
---------------------------------

Due to some limitations in the tool, the git repository containing the workspace/projects MUST be at a fixed path on
all machines.

Path : `D:\git\b-method-training\`

NOTE. AtelierB saves *absolute paths* in the configuration files. Therefore, the referenced files must acually exist at those paths
on all hosts where AtelierB is run to access the workspace and projects working with such files.
